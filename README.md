# AE370 Group Project 1 – Mass–Spring–Damper System

This repository contains the numerical analysis of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) mass–spring–damper system.  
The Forward Euler and third-order Adams–Bashforth (AB3) methods are implemented and compared in terms of **stability**, **accuracy**, and **computational efficiency**.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib


2. Open the notebook:
   jupyter notebook msd_analysis.ipynb

3. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/msd_analysis.ipynb
   ```

All generated figures will be saved automatically in the figures/ folder.
